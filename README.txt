1. Bottom Up Arroach   ===>

Solve the problem step by step from base case.


2. Top Down Approach ===> Need memoization to avoid duplication of same steps, in sub-division problems.

Divide top into sub-problems till base-case.
Solve sub-problems and use result in solving main problem



Which problem can be solved using Dynamic Prograaming

1. Overlapping subproblem: If solving same problem, multiple times. E.g. Fibbonacci number

2. Optimum Substructure:   If optimum solution can be derived from its sub-problems.
